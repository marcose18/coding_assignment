Prints the rating and total votes garnered by a movie on IMDB.

Usage:- 
python script.py 'movie name'

e.g. 
python script.py 'lone survivor'

Also there are multiple movies by the same name in many cases. So it prints ratings for all those movies. Also as an addon to the assignment it prints total votes the movie garnered for reaching that rating points. Also if the total votes for a movie is less than 5, IMDB doesn't shows it's ratings and in that case code prints rating is not available for the movie.
